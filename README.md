# Aha Loop

> From a single paragraph to a complete project — fully autonomous AI development

**Aha Loop** is a fully autonomous AI development system, extended from [Ralph](https://github.com/snarktank/ralph). It's not just an execution engine, but a complete AI development framework with **planning capabilities**, **research abilities**, and **oversight mechanisms**.

## What Aha Loop Adds to Ralph

| Original Ralph | Aha Loop Extensions |
|----------------|---------------------|
| Starts from PRD | Added Vision → Architecture → Roadmap pre-phases |
| Direct Story execution | Added five-phase workflow: Research → Exploration → Plan Review → Implement → Quality Review |
| Single execution path | Added autonomous parallel exploration (AI decides when to explore, creates worktrees, evaluates) |
| No oversight | Added God Committee independent supervision |
| Result-oriented | Added complete observability logging |

If Ralph is an **execution engine**, Aha Loop adds the **brain** (planning layer) and **eyes** (oversight layer).

## Core Principles

| Principle | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| **Unlimited Resources** | No limits on AI's compute, network, storage |
| **Never Give Up** | Auto-retry, auto-repair on issues |
| **Research First** | Learn before doing |
| **Parallel Paths** | Try all options, choose the best |
| **Independent Oversight** | God Committee monitors everything |
| **Full Transparency** | All decisions are traceable |

## Quick Start

Aha Loop is designed to work with Claude Code. Each phase is implemented as a **Skill** that you can invoke directly.

### Phase 1-3: Planning (Manual with Claude Code)

Run Claude Code in your project directory, then use skills via `/skill-name your description`:

```
# Step 1: Build Vision - Interactive Q&A to construct project vision
/vision-builder I want to build an AI gateway that unifies multiple LLM APIs

# Step 2: Analyze Vision - Extract structured requirements
/vision Analyze my project vision

# Step 3: Design Architecture - Research tech and select architecture
/architect Design the system architecture

# Step 4: Create Roadmap - Plan milestones and PRDs
/roadmap Create project roadmap and break down into PRDs
```

Each skill generates corresponding documents:
- `project.vision.md` - Your project vision
- `project.vision-analysis.md` - Structured requirements
- `project.architecture.md` - Technical architecture
- `project.roadmap.json` - Milestones and PRD queue

### Phase 4: Execution (Autonomous)

Once planning is complete, run the autonomous execution loop:

```bash
# Run PRD execution loop
./scripts/aha-loop/aha-loop.sh
```

The system will automatically execute a **five-phase workflow** for each Story:

1. **Research**: Fetch library source code, study implementations, generate research reports
2. **Parallel Exploration**: When AI identifies major technical decisions (multiple valid approaches), it autonomously:
   - Creates git worktrees for each approach
   - Runs parallel AI agents to implement each option
   - Evaluates results and recommends the best solution
3. **Plan Review**: Evaluate research and exploration findings, adjust plan if needed
4. **Implement**: Write code following research recommendations and exploration results
5. **Quality Check**: Validate implementation meets acceptance criteria

AI decides when each phase is needed. All of these are autonomous decisions. No manual intervention required.
