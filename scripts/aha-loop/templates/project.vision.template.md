# Project Vision

<!--
This is your project's vision document - the starting point for autonomous development.
Fill in each section to describe what you want to build.
The AI will use this to make architecture decisions and plan the project.

Copy this file to your project root as `project.vision.md` and fill it in.
-->

## What

<!-- One sentence describing what this project is -->

[Describe your project in one clear sentence. What is it?]

Example: "A personal finance tracker that helps users manage their budget and track expenses."

## Why

<!-- Why does this project need to exist? What problem does it solve? -->

[Explain the motivation behind this project. What problem are you solving?]

Example: "Existing apps are too complex for simple expense tracking. Users need a focused, minimal tool."

## Target Users

<!-- Who will use this product? Be specific. -->

[Describe your target users. Who are they? What do they need?]

Example: "Individuals who want basic expense tracking without the complexity of full accounting software."

## Success Criteria

<!-- How will you know when this project is successful? List measurable outcomes. -->

[List 3-5 measurable criteria for success]

Example:
- Users can add an expense in under 5 seconds
- Monthly reports generated automatically
- Works completely offline (PWA)
- Page load time under 2 seconds

---

## Constraints (Optional)

<!-- Any limitations or requirements that must be respected -->

[List any constraints on technology, time, budget, or scope]

Example:
- Must be a web application (accessible from any device)
- No paid APIs (keep operating costs at zero)
- Single developer project (limit complexity)
- Must work offline

## Technical Preferences (Optional)

<!-- Technologies you want to use or avoid -->

### Preferred Technologies
- [Technology you want to use and why]

### Technologies to Avoid
- [Technology to avoid and why]

Example:
- Prefer: Rust for backend (performance, safety)
- Prefer: Svelte for frontend (simplicity, bundle size)
- Avoid: Heavy frameworks (Next.js, Rails) - too complex for this scope

## Inspirations (Optional)

<!-- Similar products or design references -->

[List products that inspire this project, what you like about them]

Example:
- Notion - Clean, minimal interface
- Linear - Fast, keyboard-driven UX
- Splitwise - Simple expense entry

## Non-Goals (Optional)

<!-- What this project explicitly will NOT do -->

[List features or capabilities that are explicitly out of scope]

Example:
- Not a full accounting system
- Not multi-user (no sharing features in v1)
- Not for business use (personal only)
- Not tracking investments or assets
